# Secure-MLaaS
A Secure MLaaS Framework based on Intel SGX.
The framework contains two parts: model partition and model inference.


## Preparation

Make sure you have SGX v1 with limited EPC. See https://github.com/intel/linux-sgx .
## Installation 

1. Install the python packages

Install the python packages according to the `requirements.txt` on Python 3.6.9.

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Note that the TVM packages should be installed by compiled packages. 

2. Install TVM

Install TVM v0.7 from https://github.com/apache/incubator-tvm.git .
After the compilation, install the python packages.

3. Prepare the Rust environment

Open a terminal and enter the following command:
```
sudo apt install -y build-essential
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
```
This command will download a script and start installing the rustup tool, which will install the latest stable version of Rust. You may be prompted for an administrator password.
If the installation was successful, the following line will appear:
```
Rust is installed now. Great!
```

Then, you should switch the rustup toolchain to nightly. 
Install the nightly version:
`rustup install nightly`
Switch to the nightly version of cargo (nightly-2021-04-15-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu is recommended):
`rustup default nightly-2021-04-15-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`

4. Install Fortanix

Follow the instructions in https://edp.fortanix.com/docs/installation/guide/ to add the Fortanix EDP target for Rust SGX.
## Evaluation


## Brute Force 
Brute Force refers to a brute force searching algorithm to find best model partition.
A partition rule is applied, and the best situation of complexity is $O(n)$ while the worst is $O(2^n)$.
if 
$Latency_1..(n+1)â‰¤Latency_(1..n)+ Latency_(n+1)$
, do not partition.
